# RPC_Framework

This is a RPC framework based on SpringBoot framework and ZooKeeper. The project is for you to know me via a real project:  
1) my understanding of Java: Java SE, Netty, SpringBoot 
2) my understanding of Software Engineering in practice (How will I organize a software project): Clean Code, design patterns, OOP  
3) some distributed system knowledge: ZooKeeper, RPC, LoadBlancer etc
 
The basic workflow is as shown below:

Service provider (Server) <-----register service-----> ZooKeeper <------invoke service ------> Service Consumer (Client)

The ZooKeeper is playing the roles as servcie register center and load balancer.

## Communication between server and client
Based on Netty (Java NIO). I implemeneted customized encoder and decoder based on the self-defined request and response objects.

## Service Register Center
The serivces will be registered on ZooKeeper. 

## Load Balancer
I added a random based loadbalancer to ZooKeeper, hence, the client will receive response from one of the servers randomly.
